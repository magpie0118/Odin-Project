</p>

<h4>Ingredients</h4>
<ul>

    <li>1 cup Vegetable Oil</li>
    <li>1 cup All-Purpose Flour</li>
    <li>1 large Onion (chopped)</li>
    <li>1 large Green Bell Pepper (chopped)</li>
    <li>2 Celery stalks (chopped)</li>
    <li>1 pound Andouille or Smoked Sausage (sliced 1/4-inch thick)</li>
    <li>4 cloves of Garlic (minced)</li>
    <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
    <li>Creole Seasoning to taste (recommend Paul Prudhome's Seafood Magic)</li>
    <li>6 cups of Chicken Broth</li>
    <li>1 Rotisserie Chicken (boned and shredded)</li>
  

</ul>

<h4>Steps</h4>

<ol>

    <li>Heat the oil in a Dutch oven over medium heat. When hot, whisk in flour. Continue whisking until the roux has cooked to the color of chocolate milk, 8 to 10 minutes. Be careful not to burn the roux. If you see black specks in the mixture, start over.</li>
    <li>Stir onion, bell pepper, celery, and sausage into the roux; cook 5 minutes. Stir in the garlic and cook another 5 minutes. Season with salt, pepper, and Creole seasoning; blend thoroughly. Pour in the chicken broth and add the bay leaf. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer, uncovered, for 1 hour, stirring occasionally. Stir in the chicken, and simmer 1 hour more. Skim off any foam that floats to the top during the last hour.</li>
